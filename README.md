Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game built in Python. The user plays against the computer and the first one to win three matches is the winner.

How to Play
To play the game, simply run the script rock_paper_scissors.py. The game will prompt the user to input their choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors" and the computer will randomly choose its own action. The game will output who won the match and keep track of the score.

To quit the game, simply type any character that is not "x" when prompted to continue playing after each match.
